# Test app for nested dependencies

This is a rails test app where I experimented with component based architecture and local dependencies.

* `bundle`
* `rails s`
* visit: http://localhost:3000/admin/cargos
* visit: http://localhost:3000/cargos

All code is in components `admin_ui` and `public_ui`.
